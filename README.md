# Quantitative-Finance

## 🧮 SDE Simulator

This application allows users to simulate different **stochastic differential equations (SDEs)** used in quantitative finance, such as Geometric Brownian Motion, Ornstein–Uhlenbeck, and Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR). 
It also provides an interactive Streamlit interface with Monte Carlo simulations and analytical tools.
